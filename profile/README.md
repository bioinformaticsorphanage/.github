# Bioinformatics Orphanage

Inspired by [Emacs Orphanage](https://github.com/emacsorphanage).

The bioinformaticsorphange contains software that are no longer maintained upstream, but which still have users or are still required by some other packages. In the orphanage they receive only limited maintenance. Some of the packages in the orphanage are there for different reasons.

    If you would like to become the new maintainer of a package, then please contact us.

    If you no longer want to maintain a package, then transferring it to the orphanage is an alternative to just archiving the repository. That way, we can keep it usable, and if someone volunteers to become the new maintainer, you do not have to be involved in the process.
